<h1>Welcome!</h1>

<p>It's dangerous to go alone! Here, have some crabs.</p>

My small corner of the web may be small as of writing this, but it still growing, unlike me, cursed to be 162 cm forever.
I was planning to write reviews about music that I like (could be interesting), as well as share personal reflections
and anecdotes (probably less interesting).

<p>The web may need another amateur music review site, but whelp, here I am :D.</p>

<p>Whether you're methodically reading through my posts (highly unlikely) or just randomly clicking buttons (more realistic)â€”have fun!</p>
