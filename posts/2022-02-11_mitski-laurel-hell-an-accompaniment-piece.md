</figure> *Let's step carefully into the dark* is how Mitski introduces us to her sixth full-length record, *Laurel Hell*, on the track *Valentine, Texas*. It starts off slow, with only a quiet synth accompanying her vocals. The soundscape broadens as a reverb effect on her voice muddles up the space; this fades out as she utters with a slight threatening undertone, "I'll show you who my sweethearts never met." And then follows one of the most defining moments of the record -- which also deserves a jumpscare warning: a beautiful yet eerie wall of synths reminiscent of Beach House's music.

The moody atmosphere carries over to *Working for the Knife*. The track contains many elements that try to catch your attention -- the beachy guitar strumming, the sparkly piano riff that concludes most of the verses, the country twang on an electric guitar, that pat-pat-pat of a percussion instrument that I simply cannot identify, and that big menacing drone one might hear from shoegaze bands like my bloody valentine or Fleeting Joys. Meanwhile, Mitski laments as she works, lives, and dies by the knife, the road before her never changing.

The next song, *Stay Soft*, ups the tempo, as she addresses two topics not uncommon in her discography: vulnerability and sex. She calls herself a sex god who is able to give her lover whatever they want, despite their softness, or proneness to hurt, and the natural reaction of hardening themselves. Or maybe we're reading too much between the lines and it's just a song about an erection. Who knows. The drums are the driving force, taking center stage, on what might the most similar-sounding song to those from her previous album, Be The Cowboy.

*Everyone* is a meditative experience, only a monotonous drum machine beat and a synth bass sounding away for the most part of the song. Synths flare as Mitski references the dark, as though creeping up on the listener. However, she does not turn away from this. In fact, she opens the door to it and even embraces it. The ends on a high note -- piano embellishments that feel rewarding and optimistic and hopeful -- but even this is fleeting and fades out.

Following up is *Heat Lightning*, which literally and figuratively concludes Side A of the record, the side that engages more with Mitski's psyche. The slow, steady beat starts off haunting and sets up the premise. Our protagonist is lying in bed and grappling with insomnia as she ruminates on things from the past, things she ultimately cannot change. The next verse has religious undertones: "*I give it up to you, I surrender*" -- Mitski unloads her burden on an unknown entity. The song builds up and grows in intensity, before finally resolving into peaceful, ambient piano. The second half sees a dub-adjacent percussive sound on top of the underlying drums, and she reiterates her feelings.

Side B of the album explores different iterations of a relationship doomed to fall apart. It ironically begins with a dance-y new wave track titled *The Only Heartbreaker*, that finds her together with a person who is simply too good. This results with her committing all the mistakes, as is paralleled in the music video, where everything she touches disintegrates into ashes. Definitely one of the highlights in the entire record is the guitar that keeps on soaring and soaring as she, in a very suppressed tone, croons about how she apologizes and her partner forgives her ad nauseam.

We go back-to-back on new wave bangers on *Love Me More*, where, on closer inspection, Mitski questions her worth as a performer. She wonders if her audience will stay with her when she is done singing her song. The volume gets bumped up a tad during the choruses, emphasizing her desperation to simply be loved.

The next track offers a change of pace. *There's Nothing Left (Here) for You*, she sings to an ex-lover who still hasn't gotten past her. Muted drums akin to Taylor Swift's Wildest Dreams beat from under Mitski's words, as she implores the other person to just give up and leave. "*You could touch fire*," she mutters, and everything around her escalates in a wall of guitar and frenzied drums, which provide us a short cathartic moment, before it once again abruptly ends, as if being jolted awake from a dream.

On what might be the most fast-paced song on the record, Mitski remarks on how an ex-lover chooses to seek a replacement who looks just like her. Bittersweet instrumentation is sprinkled throughout *Should've Been Me*, giving the impression of regret -- it should've been her who gave her partner what they needed. 

*I Guess* is a short passage that misleads us into thinking that it's the end, as is the case with her previous label albums that all end with a stripped-back slow ballad. Reverbed piano and the plucks of a harp-like instrument give a nostalgic feel, as she reflects on a relationship that has already elapsed.

The album ends, surprisingly, with another groovy track that yet again juxtaposes sad lyrics with jolly instrumentation. She narrates how her lover doesn't love her like they used to and that fighting has become more common. The last minute on this track exudes the feeling of a credits reel, as 'sounds of people' are heard in the background of the song.

### My thoughts

This might be Mitski's most straightforward and succinct album lyrically to date. However, one can still recognize how she pulls elements from her earlier albums and incorporates them in her newest one. It combines the tongue-in-cheek lyrics from Lush with the pop sensibilities of Be the Cowboy, as well as the dynamics, shifts in loudness, and noise from both of her most punk-sounding albums, BMAMC and Puberty 2.

It took me several listens for the album to really grow on me. All of the singles save for Love Me More clicked instantly with me, but I would be lying if I said I understood Mitski's vision from the get-go. I'd like to point out an answer she had to a question in an Apple interview, how she works on albums in twos, and how the second album in the series is a refinement of the sound she utilizes. Furthermore, many tracks reference her position in the music industry and how conflicted she feels between being a product meant to be consumed and her passion for releasing music.

I understand how divisive this album's sound could be, especially with the standards Mitski has unknowingly established and the expectations fans impose on her. And the appreciation of art is subjective, so I can't fault everyone who dislikes this record. But the progression through all of her albums *does* make sense from my perspective.

Personal highlights:

- Valentine, Texas
- Working For The Knife
- Heat Lightning
- The Only Heartbreaker
- There's Nothing Left Here for You
- Should've Been Me
