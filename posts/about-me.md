# About Me

As is always the case, my brain whites out when I scramble to think of things that define me (and as an added bonus, it's going to be the only thing I'll think about when I'm busy with something else), so I'm going to proceed with the 5W+1H question word thing.

1. **Who?**

<figure class="right"><img src="public/media/new_me.JPG" alt="me" class="me" /><figcaption>Me, summer of 2021; photo taken by my boyfriend</figcaption></figure> My name is Psalm, and I'm a Filipino guy in his twenties living in Germany. I recently finished my computer science apprenticeship and am working as a software developer. Oh, you wanted to ask me something? How to pronounce my name? Everyone else back home used to pronounce my name as if the p and l didn't exist (hence: Sam), but Germans seem to think differently and pronounce _every_ letter. But I don't really mind how people pronounce it :-)

Music, cooking, and lettering are my main hobbies. I listen to pretty much everything that tickles my fancy; however, my main rotation consists of dream pop and/or shoegaze (The Radio Dept., Sweet Trip, Beach House), Japanese electropop (Kyary Pamyu Pamyu, Kero Kero Bonito), synthpop (Carly Rae Jepsen, SPELLLING, Pet Shop Boys), and folk (Sufjan Stevens, Ichiko Aoba). I'm also somewhat of a decent cook myself :D I'm always up for expanding my palate and trying new things out so I can incorporate them in my cooking repertoire. Lastly, doodling random words and lyrics has led me to the rabbit hole that is lettering — I vaguely remember everyone getting into marker lettering. To be frank, I'm way past my prime, art-wise, but I intend on practicing more often.

I also like language learning to a lesser degree; it's something I definitely want to do more from here onwards.

2. **What?**

As of now, I don't have a clear vision for the content of this blog. I _was_ leaning towards writing music reviews and perhaps even sharing my art once I've found the time as well as more creativity.

But for now, I am publishing this website at my boyfriend's behest — he has three of his own at this point and has been incessantly asking me when I would make my own, as of course I am the _computer science expert_*. (I'm kidding. I love and thank him for giving me motivation <3)

3. **When?**

I don't know how to answer this question :D.

4. **Where?**

On the interwebs...

5. **Why?**

I've always liked writing as a child. I wrote text-based role-playing games (usually in a magical fantasy setting) on old school notebooks, adding small flairs in the form of doodles. My writing rate may have dwindled over the years, but the pen has never left my hands — my desk is still littered with old to-do lists and handwritten notes for studying. Digital texts are no different, except that they're publishable online for everyone to see (\*shocked Pikachu face\*) and they don't take up any significant space on my desk :D. Having a journal in your computer also has the added bonus of easier lookup.

6. **How?**

With some trusty \*gulp\* PHP for templating and Markdown for my articles.
